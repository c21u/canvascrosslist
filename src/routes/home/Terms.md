## Combine Courses

### Read the following guidelines, then click ‘Continue’ at the bottom of the page to combine your courses.

Canvas allows teachers to move section enrollments from individual courses and combine them into one course. This feature is helpful for instructors who teach several sections of the same course and only want to manage course data in one location. These combined courses can be set in the following ways:

1.  Open Sections: Students can communicate with and view students in other combined sections.
2.  Isolated Sections: Students can only communicate with and view student in their own section. To isolate your combined sections, send a request to canvas@gatech.edu.

There are several FERPA considerations for combining sections in Canvas:

- Can I combine my sections?
  - If you teach the sections as a single course, then they can be combined. For example, if you have multiple sections that work, collaborate, or attend lectures together (either in-person or online), they could be combined.
- Should I isolate my sections?
  - Section visibility is an important option to help protect you from violating the Family Education Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). If course sections meet together and you would like students to communicate with each other, do not isolate your sections. If course sections do not meet together, we recommend isolating the sections to comply with FERPA. This setting affects all combined sections. To isolate your combined sections, send a request to canvas@gatech.edu.
- Can I isolate a single student in a combined course?
  - Yes. If you would like to limit individual users in a section – as opposed to all students in a section – to only see users enrolled in the same section, follow the instructions at <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13026" target="_blank">https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13026</a>.
- Can I combine a section I am teaching with a section taught by someone else?
  - Contact us at canvas@gatech.edu to ask a Canvas admin to combine your sections for you. In your message, include course names, teachers’ names, and a brief description of why you would like to combine your sections.
- What if I am unsure?
  - If you are unsure whether it is appropriate to combine your sections – or whether to isolate your combined sections – contact the Registrars Office at <a href="https://registrar.gatech.edu/contact" target="_blank">https://registrar.gatech.edu/contact</a> for guidance.
